Hi im jess i like coding! if u want to get to know me ur in the right place.

I've created a discord bot called "soul" just released 5/13/25 and already has 6 servers that soul is in!

I am currently devolping a speical project i might create a game pretty soon just for fun!

I like to code mostly in javascript and python, as i am still learing C++ & C sharp.

So uhm if u want to speak or join my server.

You can add my discord "illegalfunds."
